# ti-collection
My collection of programs four TI-83 and 84 calculators (in TIBASIC)

Feel free to edit any of these files. Maybe someone on my website (edticalc.weebly.com) will check this out and use your program!
GitHub does not directly support editing of .8x_ files, so you'll have to download the file in order to edit it.
You should be able to open it using this: https://education.ti.com/en/us/products/computer_software/connectivity-software/ti-connect-software/tabs/overview#!

Have fun!
